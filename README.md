# ALevel
A level project from 2017

This was one of my first big programming projects. Used a mix of different librarys to cobble together a working game. 
Learned a lot about java, xml and MIDI when making this, Looking back 3 years later I can clearly see how I would do this differently and think it would be interesting to remake this knowing what I do now.
